# Bounded authenticated catalogs for the 1 TiB release target

Status: page/record framing, typed source records, Git object fragments, local ownership and address/encryption primitives implemented; production admission
remains disabled until the complete R2/R3 acceptance gates pass. Existing revision/checkpoint formats
and their limits continue to apply.

## Problem and required capacity

The user selected 1 TiB per protected dataset, including retained history, on
2026-10-06. The current revision contains flat sector-reference and commitment
vectors. Private file metadata, the Git graph, packing maps, coding groups and
checkpoint revisions also contain flat collections. The existing transport
pages split one bounded serialized object and then reassemble it in memory;
they do not provide a scalable catalog.

A larger constant would allow one writer to publish state that another reader,
signer, checkpoint, packing or recovery path cannot process. Git already has
that problem: local graph admission and backup descriptor bounds differ.

## Direction

Use immutable, content-addressed trees of bounded catalog pages. A small root
authenticates each page's bytes, order, subtree length and page count. Hashes
bind a format version, catalog scope and section. Dataset sections bind the
guild, owner and protected root; shared packing/coding sections bind the guild
without inventing a dataset owner. Children strictly
decrease in height, so traversal cannot follow a cycle or exceed a fixed depth.
The page decoder checks encoded length and the expected reference before
interpreting the page. A consumer verifies every page it uses against its
authenticated parent, rather than trusting a peer's self-reported page hash.

The page primitive bounds encoded pages to 64 KiB, leaf payloads to
60 KiB, index fanout to 128, height to three index levels, and a section's
represented metadata to 16 GiB. These are metadata bounds, separate from the
1 TiB protected-data target. A streaming builder retains one partial leaf and
at most one index per level. Its storage callback must persist pages before
the caller publishes the root. Streaming traversal retains the bounded path
and processes leaf records incrementally. Neither path assembles a catalog
into a single vector.

The initial byte-stream builder covers full capture and format migration.
Incremental record updates still need authenticated seek/edit operations and
stable record boundaries so a changed file rewrites its pages and index path
instead of regenerating an entire section. Qualification must measure both
buffered memory and work performed for small changes to a large retained
catalog; deduplicated storage alone does not demonstrate bounded update work.

Separate sections cover file entries and extent recipes, Git refs and object
fragments, sector references and source commitments, packing/source proofs,
and coding/retirement descriptors. Large individual Git trees and file extent
lists require bounded record fragments too; opaque byte pages alone do not
fix those allocations. Private sections remain owner-encrypted. Public
packing/coding sections retain their existing authenticated authority. Page
addressing, encryption and source-sector regeneration must bind the same
scope and section as page hashing.

New signed revision and checkpoint formats carry section roots and bounded
summary counts rather than the corresponding flat collections. Their exact
format numbers will be assigned when the consumers are implemented; withdrawn
guarded private metadata formats 6/7 must never be reinterpreted as native
paged catalogs. Existing decoders and signed bytes remain unchanged.

## Admission, publication and retirement

One versioned capacity policy must be used by Git mutation preflight, native
capture, descriptor generation and recovery. In addition to the 1 TiB target,
it must specify file/namespace, extent, Git object/ref and retained-revision
limits, and how sparse logical lengths, shared inodes and unchanged historical
objects are counted. Those policy limits must be exercised before production
admission is enabled; the page primitive does not establish them.

Mutation preflight uses a prospective graph and capture manifest, counting the
actual record/page encoding and enclosing signed roots. It must finish before
visible refs, index state or protection claims are published. Oversized
existing history remains readable and exportable. Status identifies the failed
limit and the supported migration/export remedy without trimming history.

Pages belong to a durable capture/import intent until its root is committed.
Interrupted writes leave resumable ownership, not a published partial tree.
Replay validates the signed root and all required page paths before activation.
Pruning marks retained roots and streams their references using bounded local
database work; it must preserve shared pages and pending intents. Seed-only
recovery obtains authenticated roots first, then fetches and verifies pages
incrementally. Missing or corrupt pages block the affected operation.

## Implementation and qualification order

1. Add the bounded tree codec, streaming builder and authenticated traversal.
   Test order/substitution, corruption, malformed counts/heights, encoding
   boundaries and storage failure without an emitted root.
2. Add durable page ownership and public/private addressing, then bounded
   record codecs and iterators. Qualify reopen and cancellation at each write
   and publication boundary.
3. Introduce revision/Git roots and shared capacity preflight. Preserve legacy
   decoding and qualify atomic rejected commit/ref/merge/import mutations.
4. Migrate packing, coding/checkpoint replay and retention together. Preserve
   exact existing proofs, signer authority and physical cleanup semantics.
5. Qualify dense/sparse files, hard links, many small files, retained Git
   history, above-old-limit datasets, the 1 TiB boundary, interrupted backup,
   prune and seed-only recovery with measured memory/work bounds. Structural
   or synthetic scale tests supplement actual data tests; they do not count
   as a successful 1 TiB backup/recovery run.

The first increment is implemented in `crates/mb-core/src/catalog.rs`: bounded
encoding/decoding, streaming construction and ordered authenticated traversal.
Eight targeted tests and all 58 core tests pass, including legacy format
fixtures; formatting and strict workspace/all-targets Clippy pass. Exact-limit
metadata trees use repeated subtrees to exercise structural counts with bounded
construction. They do not establish real data capacity, durable page ownership,
incremental update work or end-to-end production support. Steps 2–5 remain open.

Local ownership is now implemented separately in
`crates/mb-store/src/database/catalog.rs`, using versioned protocol records in
the existing SQLCipher schema. Immutable page payloads and metadata are stored
with intent pins and parent links in one transaction. Each index is accepted
only after its immediate children are durable and verified; their existing
parent links retain the rest of the closure. Publishing a local root changes
the intent state atomically and retains its root pin. Surplus construction pins
can then be released one per transaction. Cancellation fences further writes
and publication before releasing any pin. A durable candidate queue collects
one unreferenced page and its bounded outgoing links per transaction, without
rescanning an entire catalog for every deletion. Pending and published shared
roots preserve the same immutable descendants through cancellation and reopen.

Each intent bounds its owned page count and records encoded-byte accounting.
Payloads and keys are bounded by SQL before allocation, then validated against
their expected metadata and page hashes. Four targeted ownership fixtures pass
at each page-write, publication, pin-release and page-collection reopen boundary,
including corruption and injected SQL failures. All 58 core and 79 ordinary
store tests pass; 18 provisioned store tests remain ignored. Formatting and
strict workspace/all-targets Clippy pass.

This local root is not a signed revision or a protection claim. At-rest storage
uses SQLCipher. Address/encryption primitives are implemented below; daemon
protocol integration and public authority checks remain open. Cancelled intent records remain as small fencing
tombstones until an authenticated generation-floor mechanism can retire them.
Quota/headroom reservation, record codecs, incremental updates and integration
with capture, packing, checkpoint replay, retention and seed-only recovery
remain open. Local ownership alone does not enable the 1 TiB target.

Page address/encryption primitives are implemented in
`crates/mb-core/src/catalog/privacy.rs`. File metadata and Git graph sections
are private; source references, packing and coding sections are public to their
authorized peers. A private page's storage ID is a keyed, versioned hash of the
scope, section and complete authenticated page reference. It can be derived
from a parent reference and seed-derived identity key before obtaining the
child's plaintext. Public addresses use a distinct unkeyed domain and private
sections cannot use that path. Fixed address vectors preserve the version-one
encoding and domains.

Private sealing first validates the encoded page, then uses the existing
64 KiB encrypted-sector representation. Opening checks the derived storage ID,
logical/physical lengths, ciphertext root, canonical zero padding and exact
authenticated plaintext page. Regeneration preserves ciphertext, flat roots
and Merkle commitments; missing information pages reconstruct byte-for-byte
through the existing coding path. Private plaintext page hashes/references must
stay inside authenticated owner-encrypted metadata; only keyed IDs and signed
ciphertext/source commitments belong in peer-visible catalogs. Public lookup
addresses do not supply signature or membership authority by themselves.

Seven new crypto fixtures and all 19 catalog tests pass, including fixed
vectors, corruption/rehashed corruption, key/scope/section mismatches, sector
geometry and padding, seed-derived encrypted tree traversal, and missing-page
reconstruction. All 65 core tests, formatting and strict workspace/all-targets
Clippy pass. The seed fixture proves cryptographic lookup/traversal, not an
end-to-end daemon or 1 TiB restore. Signed revision/checkpoint binding, peer
authorization, page transport, source recipes and runtime consumer migration
remain open.

Bounded record framing is implemented in
`crates/mb-core/src/catalog/records.rs`. A versioned stream header precedes
length-prefixed records of at most 48 KiB. The root binds the declared record
count and authenticated page reference; an enclosing signed or owner-encrypted
root must authenticate both together. The builder serializes into a fixed
buffer and rejects oversized values before publication. The reader handles
headers and payloads crossing leaf boundaries, bounds each allocation, and
checks final EOF before returning the final declared record. Any storage,
fetch or framing failure fences continued use.

Five new fixtures cover encoded size boundaries, cross-page framing, empty
streams, malformed/truncated/oversized/trailing frames and failure fencing.
All 24 catalog tests and all 70 core tests pass, along with formatting and
strict workspace/all-targets Clippy. Records returned by this reader are raw
bounded bytes: schema-specific decoders must still bound nested collections
and validate canonical encoding and semantics. Typed record fragments,
incremental seek/edit, quota reservation and runtime integration remain open.

Typed source records are implemented in
`crates/mb-core/src/catalog/sectors.rs`. Each version-one fixed-size record
pairs a `SectorRef` with the existing `MerkleCommitment`. The decoder bounds
encoded bytes, uses only fixed-size fields, checks canonical encoding and
validates logical length and full encrypted-sector commitment geometry.
Ciphertext flat roots and Merkle roots remain distinct authenticated values.
Builders and readers enforce strictly increasing sector IDs, rejecting
duplicate or conflicting sources without allocating a catalog-sized map.

The source root binds the record root and total logical source bytes; consumers
must authenticate both in the enclosing revision. The reader checks this
summary before yielding the final source. Unique-source logical bytes are
accounting evidence, not a retained-dataset capacity or physical quota measure.
Five fixtures cover multi-page streaming, malformed schema/encoding/geometry,
ordering and duplicates, summary substitution, and terminal storage/fetch
failure. All 29 catalog tests and all 75 core tests pass, along with formatting
and strict workspace/all-targets Clippy. Signed revision integration, shared
admission policy and file/Git/packing/coding record fragments remain open.

Git metadata-object fragmentation is implemented in
`crates/mb-git/src/object_catalog.rs`. Each commit/tree/tag has a bounded header
followed by canonical 32 KiB fragments (the final fragment may be shorter).
The builder reads an isolated object's input incrementally and requires its
exact declared length. The reader enforces increasing OIDs, contiguous offsets,
fragment geometry and complete objects. Both verify Git's type/length-prefixed
SHA-1 OID incrementally; the final fragment is withheld if the object hash or
authenticated count/byte summary fails. Blob payloads stay in source anchors.
Oversized nested fragment declarations reject before allocating their contents.

Six fixtures cover object kinds, empty trees, cross-page fragments, malformed
declarations/encoding, ordering, hash/geometry/summary corruption, truncation,
extra input and terminal input/storage/fetch failures. A generated tag larger
than the old 32 MiB descriptor bound streams through the codec and regenerates
its exact OID using independent libgit2 write streams. All 55 ordinary Git tests
pass (62 provisioned tests remain ignored), with formatting and strict
workspace/all-targets Clippy.

This object stream is not a complete Git descriptor or a protection claim.
Its root and summary require authentication inside the owner-encrypted Git
container. Consumers must reach verified EOF before activating staged objects,
retain libgit2's parsing/collision checks and validate the full graph's refs,
blob availability and reachability. Git ref/blob fragments, the shared admission
policy, bounded DAG validation, legacy migration and daemon integration remain
open; existing graph and descriptor limits are still enforced.
